# Bulk-google-website-and-job-title-search
This repository is created for bulk google search. The main idea is to take all the query from a input excel file and
the bulk search in google and save the output in another excel file.
## Usage:
* Can search anything from a column including website , linkedin page(where we can find the job titile)
* using this we do not have to search each keyword indivially 
* Running in google co lab can solve the search limits problem 
## Limitation:
* Depends of the python google library 
* Certain search limits due too many request while running locally
* Can not replace the missing value at the moment
